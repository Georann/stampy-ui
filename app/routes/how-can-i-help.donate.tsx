              All donations are helpful. A kind-hearted person with $10 extra a month, a mid-salary
              professional wishing to donate 10% of their income, or a well-off philanthropist
              looking to create major change for good can all make a useful contribution to

              The AI safety field is currently funding-limited, and there are important avenues in
              AI alignment research and AI governance that cannot currently be explored due to this
              lack of funding.

            If you have insights into the key obstacles or opportunities that could make a big
            difference, we encourage you to directly fund research, projects, or other expenses
            (like a plane ticket to a conference) for impactful individuals or small organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donating directly bypasses traditional grantmaking, providing immediate impact and
            allowing you to share valuable insights. It diversifies funding sources, reduces
            reliance on large donors, and supports those who may otherwise face a lengthy grant
            application process.

            Direct donations to larger organizations are less common, as grantmakers typically have
            a comprehensive understanding of the major players in this space and are often
            well-positioned to make informed funding decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if there is a specific organization you believe is doing exceptional work and
            would benefit from additional funds, contributing directly can still be a great choice.

          description="With a full-time job and no expertise in AI safety, I didn’t have the time or energy to figure out which projects or groups would do the most good. Then I heard about the Long-Term Future Fund, a charity which does the hard work of figuring out what to fund in AI safety. I read up about the people running it and thought they were making reasonable decisions, so I decided to donate through them. I’m very happy with my choice."
